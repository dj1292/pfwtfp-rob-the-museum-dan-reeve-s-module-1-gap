# Rob the Museum

## Learning Goals

- Read information in from CSV file
- Follow tests to establish criminal conspiracy

## Introduction

In this lab, you are a notorious art thief. Your goal is to "case" the museum
and establish critical information about the crime that you are about to commit.

## Read information in from CSV file

To start gathering information about your upcoming art heist, you will need to
import your data from the `art_heist.csv` spreadsheet.

## Follow tests to establish criminal conspiracy

Now that you have all of the data that you need, use the tests to guide you to
the following information:

- Which gallery has the most paintings?
- Which gallery has the fewest?
- Which artist has the most paintings in the museum?
- What is the total value of all of the van Gogh paintings in the museum?
- If we could steal all the paintings in one gallery to sell for money, which
  would be best?
- At the end of the lab, shout "The Goldfinch"

## Conclusion

Now you are all ready to rob the museum! Make sure to wear dark colors and don't
get caught.
