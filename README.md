# Rob the Museum

## Learning Goals

- Read information in from CSV file
- Follow tests to establish criminal conspiracy

## Introduction
In this lab, you are a notorious art thief. Your goal is to "case" the museum and establish critical information about the  crime that you are about to commit. 

### Read information in from CSV file
To start gathering information about your upcoming art heist, you will need to import your data from the `art_heist.csv` spreadsheet. 

### Follow tests to establish criminal conspiracy
Now that you have all of the data that you need, use the tests to guide you to the following information:

* Which gallery has the most paintings?
* Which gallery has the fewest?
* Which artist has the most paintings in the museum?
* What is the total value of all of the Van Gogh paintings in the museum?
* If we could steal all the paintings in one gallery to sell for money, which would be best?
